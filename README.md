# Project Title

Ballastlane Technical Exercise: Simulating a Blog Posting System

## Introduction

The Ballastlane Blog API is a straightforward web application developed as part of a technical interview exercise. It demonstrates a .NET C# application using ASP.NET Web API, emphasizing Clean Architecture principles and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies. Users can perform CRUD operations on blog records and manage user authentication without relying on Entity Framework, Dapper, or Mediator.


## Technical Architecture

### Components

- **Presentation layer**
    - **Ballastlane.Blog.Api**: Features ASP.NET Web API endpoints for CRUD operations and user management.

- **Infrastructure layer**
    - **Ballastlane.Blog.Infraestructure**: Contains service implementations that are not part of the business logic but are needed for the application to function.

    - **Ballastlane.Blog.Persistence**: Contains database repository implementations.

    - **Ballastlane.Blog.Database**: Contains all the scripts needed to build the database schema.

- **Core layer**
    - **Ballastlane.Blog.Application**: Contains business rules and validation, independent of the infraestructure layer and API.

    - **Ballaslane.Blog.Domain**: Contains entity definitions relevant to the application domain.

- **Tests**
    - **Ballastlane.Blog.UnitTests**: Covers all components, ensuring adherence to TDD methodologies.

### API Endpoints
Below are the available endpoints for the Ballast Lane Blog API, detailing how to interact with the blog records and user management functionalities.

#### User Controller
This controller defines the register and login endpoints
- **Register endpoint**: Implements the user registration. Currently, an email and a password are needed.
- **Login endpoint**: Implements user login. Users must be previously registered to log in. If the login is successful, the endpoint will generate a JWT token for interacting with the Post controller endpoints.

#### Post Controller
To interact with this controller, a JWT token is required.

- **Create post endpoint**: This endpoint allows a user to create posts.
- **Get post endpoint**: This endpoint retrieves the post specified by the user.
- **Get posts endpoint**: This endpoint retrieves the list of posts created by the user.
- **Delete post endpoint**: This endpoint removes the post specified by the user.
- **Update post endpoint**: This endpoint updates the post specified by the user.


### Development
This application was developed following Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a separation of concerns and independence of components. The development process was driven by the user stories outlined above.

## Running the Application Locally
This project is fully runnable locally, with Docker preferred for ease of setup and consistency across development environments. The applicationâ€™s architecture, design decisions, and functionality are detailed further in this document, providing a comprehensive overview for both users and contributors.


### Prerequisites
- Git
- Docker
- Visual Studio 2022

### Installation
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. **Download and run SQL Server docker image**: `docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Strong#Password" -p 1433:1433 --name ballastlane-blog -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest`

    Note: You can leave the default values, but if you want to make changes:

    - To modify the password, adjust the value here: "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Strong#Password". 
    - To change the ports, modify the `-p 1433:1433` section.
    - To set a different container name, adjust: `--name ballastlane-blog`

2. **Clong the repostiory**: `git clone https://github.com/cesarfp/ballastlane-blog.git`

3. **Publish the database**: 
- Open the Visual Studio solution.
- Go to the Ballastlane.Blog.Database and publish it. 
- Select the database instance and use "BallastlaneBlog" as database name.
    - Note: You can use a different database name however, considering update the connection string in the appsetting.json file in the web api project.

4. **Execute the application**: 
- Ensure that the Ballastlane.Blog.Api project is selected as the startup project in Visual Studio.
- Run the application.

## User Stories

1. **User Registration**

    As a new user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can login and access personalized features of the application.

2. **User Login**

    As a registered user, I want to be able to log in to the application using my credentials so that I can securely access and manage my information.

3. **Create Data Record**
    
    As a logged-in user, I want to be able to create new records in the application so that I can store information relevant to my needs.

4. **Read Data Records**
    
    As a logged-in user, I want to be able to view all my records so that I can browse the information I have previously entered.

5. **Update Data Record**
    
    As a logged-in user, I want to be able to update an existing record so that I can correct or change the information as needed.

6. **Delete Data Record**
    
    As a logged-in user, I want to be able to delete a record so that I can remove information that is no longer needed.
